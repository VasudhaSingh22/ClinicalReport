# Clinical Report Analyzer
The Clinical Report Analyzer is a sophisticated tool designed to empower healthcare professionals, researchers, and developers in extracting critical insights from medical reports. Leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and BERT-based question-answering, this project offers a comprehensive solution for in-depth analysis of clinical data.

## Key Features:

### Disease Label Extraction:
Quickly identify and analyze disease labels within clinical reports. The system categorizes reports into specific health conditions, allowing users to gain an immediate overview of the prevalence of various diseases.

### Natural Language Processing:
Utilizing the power of NLP, the tool cleans and processes raw clinical text. It employs lemmatization, sentence splitting, and keyword analysis to enhance the quality of information extraction.

### BERT-based Question Answering:
The project integrates BERT models to answer medical questions based on clinical passages. This feature is particularly useful for obtaining precise information from complex reports.

## Dataset:
The project is built upon a diverse clinical report dataset sourced from reputable sources. The dataset covers a wide range of medical conditions, providing a robust foundation for analysis and testing.

### Disease Categories:
- Cardiomegaly
- Lung Lesion
- Airspace Opacity
- Edema
- Consolidation
- Pneumonia
- Atelectasis
- Pneumothorax
- Pleural Effusion
- Pleural Other
- Fracture
